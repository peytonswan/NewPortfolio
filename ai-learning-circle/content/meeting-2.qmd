# Discussion Outline

1. Pedagogical Use Cases of AI  
2. Prompt Engineering Strategies for Learning  
3. Exploring Generative AI Providers for Canvas Integration  
4. Group Reflection & Discussion



## Case Study: Not All Chatbots Teach

- Recent study: _Not All Chatbots Teach_  
- Compared a structured, outcome-aligned chatbot vs. a generic LLM wrapper
- Key finding: Structured AI tools significantly improved student performance and clarity in software testing tasks



## Implications for Teaching

- Structure and scaffolding matter
- Alignment with learning outcomes is crucial
- Promotes metacognition and reduces surface-level AI use



## Reflect & Discuss

**Questions:**

- Where have you seen AI help or hinder student learning?
- What risks or opportunities do you see in using AI inside your own course context?



# Prompt Engineering for Learning

- Prompts = Pedagogical design space
- AI output quality hinges on the prompts we design



## Using Prompts as Guardrails

- Instructor-written prompts can:
  - Set boundaries (academic integrity, tone, focus)
  - Scaffold learning (step-by-step guidance, Socratic questioning)
  - Encourage metacognition (reflect on process)



## Prompt Examples

- "Ask the student questions to deepen their understanding of X."
- "You are a peer reviewer. Give friendly but rigorous feedback on their code."
- "Use the Feynman Technique to help the student clarify their concept."



## Reflect & Discuss

**Questions:**
 
- What kind of prompts might support your students' learning?
- How can prompt templates become reusable teaching assets?



# Exploring Generative AI Providers

- Let‚Äôs compare the top options for integration and customization:



## Major Providers

| Provider     | Notes |
|--|-|
| **OpenAI**   | GPT-4o, API access, supports embeddings, used widely |
| **Gemini**   | Google‚Äôs LLM, integrated into Google Workspace, strong data privacy controls |
| **Anthropic Claude** | Emphasizes safety and guardrails |
| **Cohere, Mistral, HuggingFace** | Research/community focused, fine-tuning support |



## Building Custom Chatbots for Canvas

üõ†Ô∏è Options include:

- **OpenAI Functions + Flask/FastAPI** backend  
- **Google Cloud Vertex AI** with Gemini + Dialogflow  
- **Custom wrappers** using LangChain or Semantic Kernel  
- Embed into Canvas via **LTI tools**, iframes, or static tools



## Reflect & Discuss

**Questions:**

- What role could a chatbot play in your course?
- Would it be formative, summative, exploratory?
- What barriers do you foresee?



# Wrap-up

Today‚Äôs Themes:

- Pedagogical framing is essential for AI tools
- Prompting is teaching
- Integration is possible ‚Äî and powerful ‚Äî in Canvas



# Next Steps
