# Interested in Research?

I regularly advise undergraduate and graduate students on research projects across a range of computing topics. If you're a student interested in conducting research with me, read on to learn more about my research areas, expectations, and how to get started.

Let’s turn your curiosity into original research!

## 🧠 My Research Interests

I supervise projects in a variety of areas including:

-   🎓 **Computing Education Research (CER)**
-   🤖 **Artificial Intelligence in Education**
-   🧪 **Software Testing and Feedback Systems**
-   🌐 **Interdisciplinary Applications of Computing**
-   🐢 **Conservation Technology and Data Science**

Learn more about my ongoing and past projects. I also welcome proposals in adjacent or new areas of computing—if you have an idea, let’s talk!

## 📝 Getting Started: Proposing a Research Project

Students interested in research should begin by drafting a proposal and reaching out to me *before the end of the semester prior* to the semester in which they would like to begin. Proposals should follow this general outline:

### 📋 Proposal Requirements

-   **Credit Hours**: Typically 2 or 4 credits depending on time commitment. (Non-credit research through a scholarship is also possible.)

-   **Initial Reading List**: Include foundational articles or papers that identify a gap in knowledge.

-   **Introductory Project**: A small starting task to demonstrate your understanding and commitment, such as replicating prior work.

-   **Project Scope**: Define what you aim to accomplish.

-   **Weekly Meetings**: You’ll meet with me regularly during the semester. These meetings are where we think, plan, and reflect together. As you come up with your proposal, consider:

    > What do you hope to accomplish in our weekly meetings? How can I best support your growth as a researcher?

    To help you frame your thinking, here are some common activities we often engage in:

    ```         
    - Discuss literature and readings
    - Generate hypotheses or goals
    - Design methodology for data collection or experimentation
    - Analyze results and plan next steps
    - Review and revise your writing
    ```

### 📄 Research Output

By the end of the semester, students are expected to:

-   Submit a research paper in a format consistent with computing research publications
-   Graduate students should aim for a conference or journal submission to disseminate their work and should minimally present at TechBytes
-   Undergraduate students present at the **Student Scholarship Recognition Day (SSRD)**, at **TechBytes** events, and should also aim for a conference or journal submission if possible

## 💡 Getting Started on a Proposal

Before reaching out to begin an Individual Research Experience for credit or scholarship, you’ll need to develop a research idea that aligns with your interests and has potential for meaningful investigation. This guide will help you get started.

### 🔍 Step 1: Explore Research Areas

Start by considering broad themes that interest you. Some areas I actively work in include:

- **🎓 Computing Education Research (CER)**
- **🤖 AI in Education & Generative Feedback**
- **🧪 Software Testing & Feedback Systems**
- **🌐 Interdisciplinary Applications of Computing**
- **🐢 Conservation Technology & Data Science**

### 🧠 Step 2: Identify a Problem or Question

Ask yourself:

- What bothers you in your field of study? What’s inefficient, unclear, or underexplored?
- Have you encountered a concept in a class that you'd like to understand better?
- Is there a tool or system that could be improved with computing?
- Can AI or data science contribute to a social, environmental, or educational cause you care about?

Jot down 2–3 questions or problems you’re curious about. Try to keep them broad at this stage.

### 📘 Step 3: Do a Quick Literature Scan

Search Google Scholar, the ACM Digital Library, or arXiv to see:

- What others have done on this topic
- How they’ve framed their research questions
- What methods they’ve used

This doesn’t have to be exhaustive—just enough to ensure your idea is novel or builds meaningfully on existing work.

### ✍️ Step 4: Draft an Initial Proposal (1–2 pages)

Bring a short, informal proposal when you first meet with me. It should include:

#### 1. **Working Title**
A descriptive placeholder is fine. e.g., *“Using LLMs to Support Early CS Students with Auto-Graded Feedback”*

#### 2. **Motivation**
Why is this topic important, timely, or interesting? What gap or problem are you hoping to address?

#### 3. **Research Questions or Hypothesis**
State your main inquiry clearly. Examples:

- *Can GPT-4 give helpful feedback on beginner Python assignments?*
- *How do students interpret different types of automated feedback?*

#### 4. **Planned Approach**
How will you explore this? Think about:

- Data sources (real or synthetic)
- Tools (e.g., GPT-4, Python, survey tools)
- Methods (e.g., prompt engineering, code analysis, surveys)

#### 5. **Dissemination Ideas**
Would you want to aim for a paper? Poster? Prototype? Public data release? Let’s set early goals.

#### 6. **What You’ll Need**
What help, access, or tools do you anticipate needing (e.g., GPT access, data, IRB approval)?



## ✅ What Happens Next?

Once you’ve drafted your initial idea, [email me](mailto:lpcordova@willamette.edu) and we’ll set up a meeting. We’ll discuss:

- Feasibility
- Relevance to your interests and my expertise
- Milestones and weekly schedule
- Deliverables and expectations

If we agree to move forward, I’ll help you refine the proposal and outline a formal plan for the term. Here's a [sample](./sample-project.qmd) of what a fleshed out project might look like.



## 📅 Tip: Reach Out Early

Please contact me **before the end of the previous term that you wish to conduct research** to give us time to plan. Proposals that involve human subjects (surveys, interviews, etc.) may require **IRB approval**, which can take time.
