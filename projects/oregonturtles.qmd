# Oregon Turtle Project: Technology for Conservation

The **Oregon Turtle Project** is an interdisciplinary initiative I worked on with [Dr. Gareth Hopkins](#0). The projectintegrates computer science and ecology in support of wildlife conservation. Focused on Oregon’s two native freshwater turtle species, the project demonstrates how technology can drive real-world environmental impact.

*The Oregon Turtle Project reflects my belief that technology, when thoughtfully applied, can play a transformative role in solving environmental and societal challenges.*

## Project Overview

Native turtle populations in Oregon, including the **Western Pond Turtle** (*Actinemys marmorata*) and the **Western Painted Turtle** (*Chrysemys picta bellii*), face growing threats from habitat loss, invasive species, and environmental changes.

The Oregon Turtle Project addresses these challenges by leveraging digital tools for efficient, accurate conservation data collection.

## Goals and Approach

Our mission is to:

-   **Streamline Field Data Collection**: Develop mobile-friendly, digital survey tools to replace traditional paper-based methods. The Oregon Turtle Project shows how interdisciplinary collaboration can create innovative solutions to urgent conservation challenges.

-   **Empower Citizen Scientists**: Provide easy-to-use platforms for the public to report turtle sightings and habitat conditions.

-   **Enhance Data Quality and Access**: Centralize ecological observations into accessible, analyzable datasets to better inform conservation efforts.

## Student Engagement

A cornerstone of this project is **student mentorship**.

Through the Oregon Turtle Project, I mentored computer science students in:

-   Full-stack software development for field research applications
-   Data science and ecological data management
-   Interdisciplinary teamwork with biologists and conservationists

Students gained hands-on experience building systems that directly impact biodiversity preservation efforts.

## Broader Impact

The Oregon Turtle Project is more than a conservation tool — it is a model for how computer science can be applied beyond traditional industry contexts.\
By bridging environmental science and technology, we are:

-   Improving the quality of ecological research data
-   Reducing the administrative burden on field scientists
-   Creating opportunities for public engagement in conservation

## Future Directions

-   **Expansion to Other At-Risk Species**:\
    Adapting our digital tools for broader use across multiple conservation initiatives.

-   **Integration with GIS Systems**:\
    Incorporating spatial mapping to visualize turtle habitats and migration patterns.

-   **Predictive Modeling**:\
    Using collected data to forecast habitat threats and support proactive conservation strategies.
