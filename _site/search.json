    "text": "Testing Tutor is a research project I co-developed with my colleagues at University of Alabama and Augusta University and several undergraduate and graduate students to revolutionize the way students learn and practice software testing. It offers a dynamic environment where learners receive structured, actionable feedback while developing deeper conceptual understandings of testing principles.\nTesting Tutor reflects my passion for improving software engineering education by bridging the gap between practice and understanding through innovative, research-based tools.\n\n\nTesting Tutor addresses a fundamental challenge in computing education:\n&gt; How do we help students not just “write tests,” but actually think like testers?\nThe system presents students with programming exercises and evaluates their test cases against underlying program behaviors. Rather than simply telling students what they missed, Testing Tutor encourages deeper learning through conceptual inquiry-based feedback.\n\n\n\n\nTwo Feedback Modes:\n\nTraditional Detailed Feedback: Similar to industrial tools, showing missing test cases and gaps in code coverage.\nInquiry-Based Conceptual Feedback: A novel mode that poses questions prompting students to reflect on their testing logic and gaps.\n\nAutomated Evaluation:\nStudents’ test cases are automatically analyzed for correctness, completeness, and redundancy.\nStudent Growth Focus:\nEmphasizes metacognitive skills — helping students understand why a test case is valuable, not just whether it passes.\nInstructor Dashboard:\nEnables educators to track student progress and adjust instruction based on common misconceptions.\n\n\n\n\nIn our study published in the Proceedings of the 52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, we found:\n\nStudents who received conceptual feedback achieved higher code coverage.\nStudents wrote fewer redundant or unnecessary tests.\nStudents earned higher overall programming grades.\nStudents developed a stronger conceptual model of software testing.\nRead the full research paper\n\n\n\n\n\nMany traditional tools provide detailed but overwhelming feedback, encouraging trial-and-error rather than understanding.\nTesting Tutor helps close that gap by:\n\nTeaching test case design as a creative, critical thinking activity.\nEncouraging self-explanation and diagnostic reasoning.\nReducing reliance on guess-and-check strategies common among novice testers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpansion to More Programming Languages: Supporting JavaScript, C++, and Python beyond current capabilities.\nDeeper Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS): Embedding Testing Tutor directly into course workflows.\nGamified Feedback Loops: Adding achievement systems to reward thoughtful test design and conceptual breakthroughs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Tutor Research Publication"
